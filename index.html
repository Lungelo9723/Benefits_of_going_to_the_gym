          <h3 class="sub-heading">a. Physical Health</h3>
          <p>
            Regular gym sessions help improve cardiovascular fitness, build
            muscle strength, enhance flexibility, and support weight management.
            Consistent training reduces the risk of chronic illnesses such as
            heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis.

          <p>
            Exercise releases endorphins- natural mood boosters that help reduce
            stress, anxiety, and depression. Many people find that gym workouts
            improve their confidence and resilience.
